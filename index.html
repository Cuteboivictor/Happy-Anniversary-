                Your presence in my life is like a serene melody, soothing and enchanting. Your laughter is the sweetest symphony, and your smile, a radiant beacon that lights up even the darkest corners of my soul. To be in your embrace is to know the truest form of happiness, a happiness that I have longed for and dreamed of.
                In every waking hour, my thoughts are with you, and in every dream, you are the muse that inspires my deepest longings. Your love is a gentle balm to my spirit, a source of solace and strength that guides me through the trials of life. 
                As we journey through the days and nights, let us hold each other close, cherishing the bond we share. I am ever grateful for your love, which has become the very essence of my existence. 
                With all the love in my heart and soul, I remain forever yours,</div>
