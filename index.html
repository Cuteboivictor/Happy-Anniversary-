Each year that passes serves as a testament to the love and devotion that have flourished between us, growing ever stronger despite the sands of time.

In the quiet hours of the night, when the world is hushed and still, I often find my thoughts turning to you, recalling the many ways in which you have graced my life. Your presence has been a balm to my soul, a source of unwavering strength and tender comfort. The joys we have shared, the trials we have borne together, all have woven themselves into the fabric of our lives, making us inseparable in spirit.

Today, as we celebrate the anniversary of our union, I find myself ever more in awe of the gentle love that has guided our journey. It is a love that asks nothing, yet gives everything; a love that has made of life a sweeter, more meaningful adventure.

Let us, my dearest, raise our hearts in gratitude for the blessings we have received and look forward with hope to the many years that lie ahead. May they be filled with the same enduring love that has brought us thus far.

Yours now and forever,</div>
